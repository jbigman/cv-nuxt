## Dependencies

#### **[Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/)**
Nuxt.js allows you to build applications by extending the functionalities of **VueJs**.

#### [@biomejs/biome](https://biomejs.dev/)
Biome analyzes code to check coding rules and conventions, as well as common error sources, to anticipate problems.  
Why use Biome instead of ESLint? Itâ€™s faster and requires fewer manual dependencies.
